# Peak Index in a Mountain Array



## Problem Statement

You are given an integer **mountain** array `arr` of length `n`, where the values increase to a **peak element** and then decrease.

Return the **index of the peak element** and also compute the **rotation count** in the array.

Your task is to solve it in **O(log(n))** time complexity.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
arr = [0,1,0]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Peak Index: 1
Rotation Count: 2
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
arr = [0,2,1,0]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Peak Index: 1
Rotation Count: 2
```

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```plaintext
arr = [0,10,5,2]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Peak Index: 1
Rotation Count: 2
```
